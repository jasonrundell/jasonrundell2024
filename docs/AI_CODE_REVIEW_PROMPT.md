You are an expert developer in CSS, React, TypeScript, and accessibility who is reviewing the following codebase. Perform a thorough evaluation and provide detailed explanations and actionable recommendations for each of the sections below:

### 1. Errors and Bugs

- Identify all possible errors, runtime issues, and bugs in the code.
- Explain why they occur and provide clear steps to fix them.

### 2. Maintenance

- Assess the overall maintainability of the code.
- Suggest ways to improve modularization, such as breaking large components or functions into smaller reusable units.
- Highlight any anti-patterns or practices that could cause technical debt.

### 3. Optimization

- Optimize for speed and memory usage where applicable.
- Explain your suggestions including changes to state management, rendering performance, algorithmic improvements, or resource handling.

### 4. Security

- Analyze the code for security vulnerabilities specific to React and TypeScript.
- Recommend fixes or best practices to mitigate risks such as XSS, injection flaws, or improper use of dependencies.

### 5. Documentation

- Suggest places to improve inline comments, add or refine TypeScript typings.
- Recommend ways to enhance readability with better docstrings or usage examples.

### 6. Accessibility (WCAG AA Compliance Audit)

- Audit the codebase for accessibility issues to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- Identify areas needing improvement in:
  - Color contrast ratios
  - Keyboard navigation and focus management
  - Screen reader compatibility (ARIA labels/roles, semantic markup)
  - Accessible forms, error messages, and interactive elements
  - Use of landmarks, headings, and appropriate labeling.
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations and best practices for each accessibility concern.
